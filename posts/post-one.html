                            <p>Ten years from now I will wake up with the help of some newfangled bionic implant adjusted to my own circadian rhythm, ready and perfectly slept. I will water some plants in my room, overlooking some sort of small garden or field. My home is minimal and bright and filled with plants. Way too many plants. I'm wearing some sort of weird new trendy skinrobe thing that helps my tissues stay supple and young. I eat some breakfast from a tube. I keep one of my eyes on the screen that's hanging over my face.</p>
<p>My work takes place outside and around the neighborhood or ideally somewhere else I've never been before. It involves the investigation and capture of life, the preservation and study of moments of time and humanity/robots. I collect scenes and data from the real world and archive it, share it, create with it. New kinds of imaging technology has drastically expanded what's possible to capture and see again and again in new ways. My daily tasks are not ever really the same, but all revolve around a stable of hobbies and habits. I collect and grow wild specimens of plants and document them in their natural habitats as well as their lifecycles in my home lab. I sell the captures I create and use the data from them to learn more about the world and spread an appreciation of the things I am interested in with others. The economy that exists now is very different from the one ten years earlier, and the production of goods has changed a lot. The capture and process of information and data is the most valued behavior and the most beneficial to others. Collectively humanity has moved closer to becoming a singular organism regulated via technology and new methods of using AI in social systems. I am at peace and harmony with this new balance and have found a way to make a living for myself through it. My needs are met through exchanges of goods and services on platforms connected to global trade, much like the bartering system on steroids.</p>
<p>During my day I'm spending my time with others who are partaking in the same activities, people who I have either met online and exist in real-time with daily or who actually live and work in my environment. The connection of communities online has led to me not having to spend much time with those who are not focused on my interests if I don't want to, and specialization has taken everything to a new level of personality in regard to atmosphere and experience. My day is most filled collecting and recording and documenting, but at my leisure. I am something of a curator now. I am interacting with what's in front of me and making the most of it using technology.</p>
<p>My personal life is probably still pretty solitary, but I like to think there is someone there with me who shares my interests and can grow with me over time. This is someone who shares my outlook on others and hope for the future and contributes toward that in their own creative ways. Balancing my life and work isn't really an issue, since my life is my work and since work has been expanded to life. I'm eating synthetic proteins and other homegrown nutrients regularly. I have a curated feed of information that pertains to my work and my interests which keeps me informed, and I upload my own thoughts to others using real-time communication methods as the day goes on.</p>
<p>My day winds down with the usual flow of inputs informing me of my progress through the day and the updating of tasks begun in the morning and tasks set to run at night. I water some more plants and set the machine house I live in to continue calibrating for another day. I go to sleep content in the belief that my work is providing something to the world around me.</p>
